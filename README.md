Rainfall Prediction with Scikit-learn
This project utilizes Scikit-learn to predict the likelihood of rainfall on the following day by analyzing 10 years of historical weather data. The aim is to create an accurate predictive model that can assist in weather forecasting.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned 10 years of weather data, handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data, such as the impact of temperature, humidity, and wind speed on rainfall.
Feature Engineering: Selected and engineered relevant features to improve the model's accuracy.
Model Development: Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, to predict rainfall.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring reliable predictions.
This project highlights proficiency in data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning to solve real-world problems.
